Array is data structure of fixed length and the size needs to be defined during declaration itself.

String [] names=new String[100];

This is because all the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations and so It needs to know how much memory needs to be allocated based on size.
If the array were to be resized later on, that other information would have to be moved somewhere else in order for the array to get bigger. That's a lot of shuffling that we don't want to deal with, so computer architects disallow array resizing to make things simpler.

One indirect way to avoid declaration of size is to use an ArrayList to add elements and then convert to array.
